.. caution:: Please ensure you have read through the :ref:`Basic Config <basicconfig>` before moving to this section
             This avoids issues such as the bot not announcing anyone.

Whilst the main platforms of Twitch and YouTube have dominated the market, there are other platforms that cater to more specialist
topics and subjects and as we are able, we will add them to our supported platform list.

.. Important:: To remove a creator, run the command again!
